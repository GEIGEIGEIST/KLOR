# KLOR SPLIT KEYBOARD

KLOR is 36-42 keys column-staggered split keyboard. It supports a per key RGB matrix, encoders, OLED displays, haptic feedback, speakers, a Pixart Paw3204 trackball, the [SplitKB tenting puck](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck) and four different layouts, through break off parts.

## PCB 

[Here](/PCB/) you can find the KiCad files and Gerbers for the KLOR. 

***

## CASE

[Here](/case/) are the case files for the KLOR. There is an acrylic case and a 3D printed case (which uses acrylic too) for every layout.

***

## SWITCHPLATE

In every case directory you'll find the matching switchplates as **.dxf**, **.svg**, **.stl** and a **.zip**-file, containing gerber files for a FR4 plate.

***

## KNOB

You can use pretty much any knob, which works with EC11 encoder, but [here](/knob/) you can find one, I designed for the KLOR.
