# KLOR PCB FILES

## MANUFACTURING
If you want to get the PCB made you need to add the files in the [gerbers folder](/PCB/klor1_3/gerbers/) to a ZIP file and upload it to the website of the manufacture ([JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) for example).

- create a ZIP file from the [gerbers folder](/PCB/klor1_3/gerbers/)
- upload the ZIP
- sometimes the Gerber preview from JLCPCB can't display the PCB, even when the files are fine. In this case use this dimensions: 159.8 mm* 118 mm
- PCB Thickness 1.6mm
- 2 layers
- PCB Qty as much as you like. But be aware, that you need 2 PCBs for one keyboard
- PCB Color Black
- No impedance control
- Surface Finish HASL(with lead) if you want the easiest soldering experience or LeadFree HASL.
- Remove Order Number Yes

## CHECK TRACES OR PINOUT

If you only want to check the traces or see what is connected to which pin you can take a look at these graphics.

## TAKE A DEEPER LOOK OR MODIFY 

You can download the project if you need to take a deeper look or modify something. You need the Open Source software [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) to open it.
